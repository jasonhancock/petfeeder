A Raspberry Pi powered cat feeder

## Why?

My family is preparing to take a trip and the folks who usually look after our cat are also out of town. Rather than put him in a kennel, leave out a big bowl of food, etc., I decided to wire up something myself.

## Requirements

* Deliver approximately 1/3 cup of dry cat food three times daily at 06:30, 17:30, and 21:00.

## Hardware

I built this mainly out of components I had on hand. The only thing I needed to purchase was a little bit of lumber, some screws, nylon standoffs, and the cereal dispenser.

* Raspberry Pi Zero
* USB OTG adapter
* USB WiFi Card
* Pin header for Pi Zero
* 5V micro USB power supply
* 12V power supply
* ULN2803 darlington array
* Relay board
* 12V, 6 RPM motor
* Motor mount bracket
* 6mm to 1/4" coupler
* 5" of 1/4" D shaft
* Cereal dispenser
* 1"x3" pine lumber
* Wood screws
* nylon standoffs
* #6 x 1" machine screws
* #6 washers
